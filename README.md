# Belly Button Biodiversity

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to create an interactive web visualization of a dataset of different bacteria present in the belly buttons of a sample of individuals. The visualization was created using Javascript and HTML. Javascript was used in order to load the data and organize the data into the page's HTML. The data that is displayed on the pages' tables and graphs is an individual's bacteria data and is able to be changed using the test subject ID selector.
